**FOR PROBLEM 1**
- Loading a CSV file requires the syntax "pd.read_csv()" and inputs the filename inside the parentheses. It allows the uploading of a file that can be manipulated and defined.
- To display the first 5 rows and the last 5 rows, use the syntaxes ".head()" and ".tail()" respectively.

**FOR PROBLEM 2**
- To obtain a particular location in a data, use ".loc" or ".iloc". It lets the user select a specific index, row, or column to be displayed.
- For the initial condition of odd numbers, it requires skipping 2 index values. The syntax is ":2".
